Accessibility in software engineering is removing barriers and ensuring everyone can equally perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to a system.

Imagine a well-designed library with ramps, clear signage, and audiobooks for those who need them. Accessible software is like that library, removing obstacles like:

- **Visual limitations:** Offering high contrast, screen reader compatibility, and zoom options.
- **Motor limitations:** Supporting keyboard navigation, voice commands, and assistive devices.
- **Cognitive limitations:** Using clear language, predictable layouts, and alternative input methods.
- **Auditory limitations:** Providing captions, transcripts, and alternative sound outputs.

By embracing accessibility, developers create software that empowers everyone, regardless of ability, to fully participate in the digital world. It's about opening doors, not closing them.
